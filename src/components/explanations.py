**How to interpret:**
This value shows the average distance between every pair of player positions on the field.
A higher number means the positions are more spread out from each other.
A lower number means the positions are closer together.

**How to interpret:**
This value is the standard deviation of the x-coordinates (left-to-right positions) of all players.
A higher value means the positions are more widely spread across the width of the field.
A lower value means the positions are grouped more closely together horizontally.

**How to interpret:**
This value is the standard deviation of the y-coordinates (front-to-back positions) of all players.
A higher value means the positions are more spread out along the length of the field.
